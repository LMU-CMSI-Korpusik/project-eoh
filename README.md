FAKE NEWS CLASSIFIER. -Owen Hunger, Evan Yu, Hetanshee Shah

1. Project Goal or Hypothesis:

The objective of our project is to develop a fake news classifier using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Our hypothesis is that by using these techniques, we can create a model capable of accurately distinguishing between fake and genuine news articles based on their titles. This classifier aims to contribute to ongoing efforts combating misinformation and to also promote media literacy. We found some inspiration from twitterâ€™s community notes, which flags posts that have fake information in them, supplementing with correct sources. These have pro-fact checkers but also seem to have AI/NLP systems in place for less popular notes. Expanding this could be a powerful tool for weeding out fake posts among the billions of posts that are on these platforms. 

2. Proposed Approach:

Dataset: We will utilize a kaggle fake news dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv, which contains news articles along with corresponding labels indicating their authenticity. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training and testing our fake news model.
